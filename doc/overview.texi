Racdoor is the product of over 500 years of development at the Galactic Security
Agency (GSA) in service of the Galactic Security mission and represents the most
significant advance in cyber capabilities in recorded history.

It allows for a covert implant to be injected into a Ratchet & Clank (PS2) save
game such that the payload code embedded in the file is executed on the victim
console shortly after the file is loaded by the game.
